    <h1>Mini project on HTML & CSS</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Read the given instructions given below before doing your project</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The project for your HTML & CSS will be a <code>“mini-web site"</code>Choose a topic that interests you:
            something that excites you, something you want to tell the whole world about. If you t care about the
            subject, your readers wont either.
        </li>
        <li>
            I want you to concentrate on the HTML, not on finding content, so do not choose a topic that requires lots
            of research. For example, unless are an expert about the subject, a web site about the kings of Sweden will
            need much time-consuming research. On the other hand a website about your favorite hobby won’t take much
            research at all.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Here are further requirements for the assignment:</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Your project must contain a minimum of ten original HTML5 pages (files) that you have written. A single
            HTML5 file with links to nine pages written by other people is not acceptable. You may not simply link to
            pages that you have practiced for the HTML & CSS. Your material must all be original
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Diagram showing links among an index page and other content pages is shown in the Sample linkage
            <br>
            <br>
            <div>Example:<img src="img.jpg" alt="Html image"></div>
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            You must draw a diagram showing how your HTML pages link together, and the linkage must make sense. For the
            linkage diagram you can use any online tools to draw or you can make your diagram by hand then scan it or
            take a digital photo of the diagram and upload it to the <code>GitHub.</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                Note:A linkage diagram is not the same as a diagram showing. If you have many pages that are all linked
                to each other, just draw a line that connects them all and label it with words like “all linked to each
                other” rather than trying to draw dozens of lines with arrows on them.
            </div>
